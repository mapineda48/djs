# Nodejs Demos

Packages to play and learn [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).

# About this repo

- Each folder in the repository root directory is a node js package.
- if you're wondering why i don't have one repository per package ... well i started with the thread workspace, after a while i started to feel like i didn't need it, move on to lerna workspace with a separate version of the packages I also feel like I don't need it

# Keep in mind

- [GitHub packages](https://docs.github.com/es/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages).
