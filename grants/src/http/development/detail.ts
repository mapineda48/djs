      '<p><span style="color: red;">The close date above is the date for the Step-1 proposal submission. See the solicitation for the Step-2 due date. Step-2 proposals cannot be submitted if a Step-1 proposal was not submitted.</span></p> \n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p><span style="color: black;">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2020 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2020. In this case "omnibus" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2020 solicitation, and the "Summary of Solicitation" as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020" target="_blank" style="color: black;">http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020</a><span style="color: black;">.</span></p> \n<p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style="color: black;">This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables&nbsp;</span><a href="http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">2</a><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><a href="http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table3" target="_blank" style="color: black;">3</a><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;of this NRA at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table2" target="_blank" style="color: black;">http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table2</a><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table3" target="_blank" style="color: black;">http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table3</a><span style="color: black;">, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under "Announcement Documents" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in&nbsp;The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH20ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow&nbsp;</span><a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId=%7b7A756443-C6CD-2741-5652-596407CEF871%7d&amp;path=open" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(68, 114, 196);"><u>the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element</u></a><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;and then to read the text of the call one would click on&nbsp;“C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)”</span><span style="color: purple;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read&nbsp;“C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)” from that same page.</span><span style="color: blue;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black;">While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the overview.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style="color: black;">Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs</a><span style="color: black;">.

      "Proposers must be affiliated with an institution at nspires.nasaprs.com/ and, in general, NASA provides funding only to US institutions.  Organizations outside the U.S. that propose on the basis of a policy of no-exchange-of-funds; consult the Guidebook for Proposers (http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/) for specific details. Some NRAs may be issued jointly with a non-U.S. organization, e.g., those concerning guest observing programs for jointly sponsored space science programs, that will contain additional special guidelines for non-U.S. participants.  Also reference the Guidebook for Proposers for special instructions for proposals from non-U.S. organizations that involve U.S. personnel for whom NASA support is requested.",
